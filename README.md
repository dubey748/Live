Key Features Full-Stack MERN: Utilizing MongoDB for the database, Express and Node.js for the server, and React for the frontend, we're creating a robust and scalable application.

Modern Frontend: We use Vite as the frontend build tool, React for UI components, and Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.

State Management: Redux Toolkit is employed for state management on the frontend, enabling efficient data handling and user interactions.
